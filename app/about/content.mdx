I'm a software developer and data enthusiast with a strong focus on building intuitive and scalable web applications, as well as leveraging data for insightful decision-making. I specialize in **React.js**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** for front-end development, while also working with **Python**, **SQL**, and **Machine Learning** frameworks for data analysis and model building.

I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects that combine web development and data analytics. From developing interactive and scalable web applications to designing data-driven solutions, my projects reflect a blend of technical expertise and problem-solving skills.
